## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies
```
yarn install
```
3. Start project with following comment:
```
yarn start
```

## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `src/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

That's it!
